<!--Using only ES6 syntax, write a function for each question to accomplish the following 
(hint write clean code, use some of these functions as 'helper functions' in other answers):-->



<!--1)Logs a message saying 'Hello world'. Call the function.-->






<!--2)Takes a string and logs 'it is [STRING]'. Call the function with an arbitrary string.-->







<!--3)Takes a temperature and logs whether that temperature is hot (above 72) or cold (below 40). 
Call the function with an arbitrary temperature.--> 






<!--Takes an array of temperatures and logs 'on day [number], it is [hot/cold]'. If it is neither hot or cold, the string should read 'today is a good day'. 
Call the function with an arbitrary array.-->
