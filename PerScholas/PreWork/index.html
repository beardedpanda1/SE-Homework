	<p style="font-family:cursive">Like many of you here, I'm looking for ways to turn my talents into digital works of art. I've dabbled in coding before but nothing like a commitment such as this. I'm adventurous and I just go with the flow. Most of all, I'm passionate about making a difference in my community in a positive way and I believe going through this course can help me with that. I've spent most of my life working with nonprofit organizations and it honestly amazes me how much heart the community has as a whole and why I refuse to give up on those that continue trying.</p>

	<p style="color:blue">Here are some of the things I've worked on</p>
	<ol>
		<li style="font-family:cursive">Mentoring Youth</li>
		<li style="font-family:cursive">Tutoring those that sought help</li>
		<li style="font-family:cursive">Organizing events that benefited the less fortunate</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 style="font-family:cursive">Things that make me tick</h2>
		<p style="font-family:cursive">I find meeting new people facinating. Being able to learn about them, and what interests them drives a meaningful conversation that develops understanding and builds bonds. I love making people smile. sometimes you can forget its even the smallest things that can mean the most in the world. A simple smile and an appropriate handshake can be the difference gearing toward a successful counter with a client. I wasn't always so extroverted. Growing up, I always had an introverted personality and more often than not prefered to be by myself. However when I started going to college, I was hit with this need to be social. You are who you surround yourself with. Be around motivated individuals and you're more likely to succeed. As of now, I'm ready to grind this course out and get to work! </p>

	<h2 style="font-family:cursive">Stressed out?</h2>
		<p style="font-family:cursive">The pandemic served as a special time for me because that was when I was forced to really sit in seclusion and take a good hard look at myself. I was able to hone in and try the things I was too scared or lazy to do. Some of these things include:
			<ol style="font-family:cursive">
				<li class="interests">Anything outdoorsy</li>
				<li class="interests">Gaming</li>
				<li class="interests">Woodworking</li>
			</ol>
