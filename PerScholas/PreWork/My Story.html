	<p style="font-family:cursive;text-align: center;font-size: 20px;">I grew up in a typical immigrant household with parents who held high expectations. Fortunately I met none of them. I stayed in school, kept up my grades, eventually graduated high school but once college hit, I started questioning life. That is where I began to find myself. I made friends, fell in love, lost some people but life is amazing when you have a positive outlook. I did amazing things I never thought myself capable of and steered myself in that direction. I found myself spiritually and more motivated to try and live life on my own terms. I consider myself a bit of a daredevil. Sure I've had some close calls but who hasn't? What matters is I grew some sense before anything serious happened. I've been skydiving, been on trips that were poorly planned, tried to build a project car with some friends, and even snuck into an abandoned asylum that shut down in the 70s.</p>

	<p style="font-family:cursive;text-align:center;font-size:20px">But why did I get so brave? I always tried to meet expectations but around the first year of college, my father got sick and I took a semester off to help take care of him. I go through life with one simple saying and its never let me down. Live life with no regrets. If something doesnt work out, than something else will come along. All you have to do is keep trying.</p>
