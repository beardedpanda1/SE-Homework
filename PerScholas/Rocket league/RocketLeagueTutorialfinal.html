If youre playing on PC, you have to download the EPIC GAMES client before you can even access the store but the entire process is so effortless. Consoles, both last generation and current like Playstation, XBox, and Nintendo all have access to the game via their respected online stores. Once downloaded, you're placed in a tutorial that walks you through the fundamentals to playing the game. After that, the ceiling is the limit, quite literally. Yes you read right. This is a game where you hit the ball with rocket powered cars. Even though this game came out just over 6 years ago, new mechanical play styles are still coming out. All of this is due to the beautiful fact that this is a purely physics type application. There are so many cars in the game at this point with different hitboxes appealing to everyone!</p>
